# Python_config_Transform
Have you ever encountered the need to change the type of a config file

Lucky for you I did and I found no help when I searched for so, so I took it personally

And made a config changer so you don't have to

changes json, yaml or even ini

to each other

# What it does
yaml to ini

yaml to json

and vice versa

# yaml to json
dh = dict_Handler(file.yaml)

dh.to_json

now you don't need to look for more

# later updates might include
-being able to specify the output location

-xml support

-env support
